A little project that I made for work as I missed a tool that did just that.

It's basically a counter that helps keeping track of offering products.
It was quite a struggle to develop as I didn't have a server or the knowledge to use a server.
The project needed to be inside the companys possibilities, which ended up using Microsoft Sharepoint.

My lackluster knowledge of JavaScript didn't help much, as the concept of event listeners was lost on me.
It was a good little thing to make as I learned some really basic things in a small context.
