# Digital-Reporting
A little project that I made for work as I missed a tool that did just that.

It's basically a counter that helps keeping track of offering products.
It was quite a struggle to develop as I didn't have a server or the knowledge to use a server.
The project needed to be inside the companys possibilities, which ended up using Microsoft Sharepoint.
